                    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">The Seamaster Aqua Terra is a superb tribute to OMEGA's rich maritime heritage. This 41 mm model has a symmetrical stainless-steel case with a screw-in caseback featuring a wave-edged design. It has a lacquered black varnish dial with rhodium-plated diamond-polished OMEGA logo, and date window at 6 o'clock. The hands and hour markers, also rhodium-plated, are filled with white Super-LumiNova which emits a blue glow. The watch is presented on an integrated bracelet with polished central links and brushed external links and powered by OMEGA's Co-Axial Master Chronometer calibre 8900, certified at the industry's highest standard by the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS).</p>
